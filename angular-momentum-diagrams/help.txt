This tool is very much a work in progress.  Beware of incomplete features,
bugs, etc.

Right now, there is no plan to make this work on mobile, sorry.  You need a
relatively modern browser, and a working mouse with a scroll-wheel button.

Unfinished major features:
- Pinching rule (orthogonality) is not yet implemented
- Cutting rule (factorization/separation) is not yet implemented
- Reversed pruning rule (zero delta) is not yet implemented
- Triangular deltas are not yet tracked
- No way to rename the variables yet

Layout
======

The main area shows the diagram, of course.

The right panel shows the tableau, which tracks phases, weights, and other
tedious details.

The bottom panel, if clicked, will display the equation.  This equation is not
updated automatically (because MathJax is really slow).

Usage
=====

There are two kinds of things you can do in the editor:

  - Editing:
      - These often violate equivalence.
      - You can disable editing by toggling the frozen mode ([f] key).

  - Applying rules:
      - These always preserve equivalence (if not then it's a bug...)

You can "undo" by clicking the back button on your browser.  Note that every
change to the diagram automatically updates the URL, so you can "save"
diagrams by bookmarking the URL.  You can also send it to other people.  (Be
aware that the URL can get very very long for complicated diagrams!)

Editing
-------

[w]: create a Wigner 3-jm symbol at the location of your cursor
[c]: create a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient at the location of your cursor
[m]: create/flip/destroy a Wigner 1-jm symbol on the line at
     the location of your cursor
     (this is simply a (-1)^(j - m) phase factor)
[j]: on a line, this will create a (-1)^(2 j) phase factor
     on a Wigner 3-jm node, it will flip the node without changing any phases

[a]: attach/join two nearby terminals, forming a single line
[x]: delete a node or a free line
[f]: turn frozen mode on or off (this disables editing)
[r]: reset and clear the entire diagram
     (note if you encounter a bug in the app and [r] doesn't work,
      you can still click on this button as a link to reset!)

Rules
-----

First of all, you're allowed to move things around freely (with the exception
of the terminals, which remain fixed).  You can drag nodes, lines, arrows, and
labels.

These are the explicit rules that you can use.  Don't worry about the
phase factors or weights: the editor will automatically adjust them :D

- [Right-click] on a node to flip the orientation.
  This changes the phase by (-1)^(j1 + j2 + j3)

- [Shift] + [Right-click] on a node to change the phase by
  (-1)^(j1 + j2 + j3)

- [Middle-click] on a node to change the surrounding arrows

- [Right-click] on an arrow to flip the arrow.
  This changes the phase by (-1)^(2 j)

- [Shift] + [Middle-click] on a node to simplify a node that is connected to
  itself (pruning rule).

Interpretation
==============

Here, arrows on the diagram are interpreted literally as (-1)^(j - m) phase
factors, accompanied by a reversal of the sign of m.  This makes their
behavior somewhat different from the conventional Jucys diagrams where arrows
signify variance.  The end result is that the rules are (IMO) much more
mechanical and translate easily to an equation.  There is a cost though, in
that certain "unsaturable" diagrams can occur if the diagrams are not
manipulated carefully.  Eventually, the goal is to have the application tell
you when the diagram has reached an unsaturable state, but this is not yet
implemented.
