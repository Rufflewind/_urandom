# rndtest

Check whether the `srand()` seed is shared between dynamically-loaded

 - On Linux, use `./make` to run the test.  You might have to modify the
   script to find the Qt libraries.
 - On Windows, use `make.bat` to run the test.  You will need to use the MSVC
   Command Prompt to do this.  You might have to modify the script to find the
   Qt libraries.
